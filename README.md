    <h1>Welcome! This is my first HTML Project!

    <h2>I plan on creating <em>multiple</em> projects every week to show my knowledge and understanding of the languages. This is not a specific build or
project but it is just a display of my understanding of HTML elements and semantics as I
continue on my journey of learning more everyday.
    </h2>
    <p>I just started taking onlines courses on youtube to learn the most foundational languages.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently learning:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>HTML</li>
       <li>CSS</li>
       <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. My Experiences So Far?
    </h2>
    <p>It's been pretty challenging learning all of these languages, but overall I enjoy learning the skill as a whole. I usually start coding first thing in the morning at 8am to about 12pm.I will start off with HTML lessons; then I will work my way all the way through CSS down to JAVASCRIPT. I find it beneficial to allow my brain to dive into each language everyday to keep my coder mind flowing & to not stay stagnent.

    <h2>2. Why I Want To Code?
    </h2>
    <p>When I was a child, I was always drawn to computers. I loved tech, games and social applications from the dawn of the age. I remember building my own myspace page and I will never forget the day Facebook launched and blew myspace out of business. I really want to be apart of the future development of society and apart of the future digital infrastructure.

          <summary>What's my favorite language?          </summary>
    <p>I don't have a favorite, I <em>"LOVE"<em>CODING in general!
    </p>
    </details>
    <p>I am already a spiritual person and I see life in a different way than others. The way I see coding is in the same manner. I see coding to be the invisible realm in the phyisical world of computers. Most of the time it is over-looked, but little do we know its the key factor to all physical life/computing life.

    <h2> 3.Where Do I See Myself In 5 Years?
    </h2>
    <p>In 5 years, I see myself going very far and creating a great name for myself in the software development space.I know things will not be easy or get easier, as it wasn't even easy for me to make it this far. Being a coder is about loving problems and being solution based. I have a great understadning of that, so I know I will be in the space for the long haul. Making a long story short, I see myslef being a "Senior Developer In 5 Years & maybe even better". After I knock out and have a clear understanding of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT; I will move on the more challenging languages like:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>PYTHON</li>
       <li>REACT</li>
       <li>SQL</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Where Do I Think I Should Strengthen My HTML Coding Currently?
    </h2>
    <ol>
       <li>ADDING LINKS</li>
       <li>ADDING TABLES</li>
       <li>ADDING AUDIO</li>
       <li>ADDING VIDEOS</li>
       <li>BETTER SEMANTICS</li>
       <li>ADDING BUTTONS</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is my first coding project, so my intentions isn't to make this one super fancy. You will see my growth as I continue to implement what I learn in future projects. See you on the next project!
